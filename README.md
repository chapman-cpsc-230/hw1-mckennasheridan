## Description

For this assignment, I had to write 3 programs using python. First, I created a calculator to convert seconds to years. Second, I calculated the interest rate of a given principle. Third, I was given three codes and I had to fix the bugs within these three codes.

## What I Learned from This

From this exercise, I learned how to create simple codes using variables and the command print. I also learned how to fix bugs in programs.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

McKenna Sheridan
